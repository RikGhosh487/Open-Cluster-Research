# Open Cluster Research
This is the Data Science component of the **Astrometric**, **Photometric**, and **Spectroscopic** analysis of an Open Star Cluster.

## Search Parameters
| Parameter | Data |
| :--: | :--: |
| Right Ascension (α) | 345.67348 |
| Declination (δ) | 59.55911 |
| Search Radius | 10' |

There were **7400** data points in [raw_data.csv](https://github.com/RikGhosh487/Open-Cluster-Research/blob/main/raw_data.csv). After dropping the rows with missing fields, there were **7153** data points. After enforcing statistical data reductions on the errors, there were **5927** data points that get compiled into [reduced.csv](https://github.com/RikGhosh487/Open-Cluster-Research/blob/main/reduced.csv). Additional hardcoded restrictions were imposed on `reduced.csv` to remove obvious outliers from the Vector Point Diagram generated by the data points. The resulting data file had **5816** data points. From that **38.3%** of the data was extracted to perform a *mean-centered* parallax adjustment and was compiled into [restricted.csv](https://github.com/RikGhosh487/Open-Cluster-Research/blob/main/restricted.csv) which contains **2762** data points. There was a total of **37.32%** of data that was retained from `raw_data.csv`.

## Initial Histograms
***NOTE:*** All Margins of Error (M) are calculated using `M = 2 * std / sqrt(N)` where `std` is the standard deviation of the data, and `N` is the number of data points. This information was obtained from [Guide to Computing Margins of Error for Percentages and Means](http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/marginsoferror.htm)
